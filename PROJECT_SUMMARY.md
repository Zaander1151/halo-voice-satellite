## 🎯 Design Specifications

### Chosen Design: HALO (Curved Minimalist)

**Key Features**:
- Curved front panel (40mm radius)
- Concentric mesh pattern (2mm holes, graduating sizes)
- Tapered profile (90mm front → 75mm back)
- 6-clip press-fit assembly (no screws visible)
- Integrated keyhole wall mounts (50mm spacing)
- USB port cutout (12×8mm with chamfer)

**Targets**:
- Print time: <7 hours total
- Material: <70g PLA/PETG
- Weight: <75g empty
- Dimensions: 90×65×45mm

**Why Halo?**
1. Solves all issues from previous design (thick panel, disconnected aesthetic)
2. Achievable with standard FDM printing
3. Timeless, elegant design
4. Creates beautiful LED light patterns
5. Tool-free assembly

## 🚀 Next Steps (Development Roadmap)

### Phase 1: CAD Modeling (This Week)
1. Model curved front panel with parametric mesh
2. Create mesh pattern generator script
3. Model main body with tapered profile
4. Design press-fit clip mechanism
5. Add component mounting bosses
6. Verify clearances and fitments

### Phase 2: First Prototype (Next Week)
1. Print front panel
2. Print main body
3. Test component fit
4. Verify clip mechanism
5. Test USB access
6. Iterate based on results

### Phase 3: Documentation (Week 3-4)
1. Create assembly guide with photos
2. Write detailed print settings guide
3. Create wiring diagram specific to Halo
4. Photograph build process
5. Write troubleshooting guide

### Phase 4: Release (Week 5)
1. Final STL files
2. Complete documentation set
3. Community testing
4. Version 1.0 release

## 💡 Design Philosophy

**Core Principles**:
1. **Form follows function** - Every curve, every hole serves a purpose
2. **Simplicity** - Minimal parts, minimal hardware, minimal assembly
3. **Elegance** - Should look intentional, not 3D printed
4. **Accessibility** - Anyone with a 3D printer should be able to build this
5. **Maintainability** - Easy to open, service, and modify

## 📝 Notes for Development

- Original enclosure photos reviewed (white body, orange front, hexagonal mesh)
- Issues identified: thick front panel, disconnected aesthetic, no USB access
- All original electronics will be reused (no BOM changes)
- Design optimized for standard 0.4mm nozzle
- Tolerances designed for typical FDM printer capabilities
- Wall mounting supports up to 200g total weight

## 🎊 Ready to Build!

The Halo Voice Satellite project is now fully initialized and ready for development. All tracking systems are in place, documentation structure is set, and the Git repository is configured.

**Current Status**: Day 1, Phase 1 (CAD Modeling)  
**Next Action**: Begin modeling curved front panel in CAD
