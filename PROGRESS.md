# HALO VOICE SATELLITE - DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS LOG

---

## 📅 2025-11-27 - Project Initialization

### 🎉 Project Created
**Time**: 07:30 UTC  
**Status**: 🟡 Setup Phase

### Actions Taken
1. ✅ Created project directory structure
2. ✅ Initialized feature tracking system (FEATURES.md)
3. ✅ Created comprehensive README
4. ✅ Prepared for Git repository initialization

### Design Decisions Made
**Chosen Concept**: Halo (Curved Minimalist Design)

**Rationale**:
- Addresses all issues with previous design (thick front panel, disconnected aesthetic)
- Achievable with standard FDM printing
- Timeless aesthetic won't look dated
- Creates beautiful LED light patterns with concentric mesh
- Tool-free assembly simplifies build process

**Key Design Parameters**:
- Front panel curve: 40mm radius
- Taper: 90mm (front) → 75mm (back)
- Mesh: Concentric circles, 2mm holes, graduating sizes
- Assembly: 6-clip press-fit system
- Wall mount: Vertical keyhole slots, 50mm spacing
- USB access: Bottom edge cutout, 12×8mm with chamfer

### Current Status
- **Total Features**: 43
- **Completed**: 0 (0%)
- **Failing**: 43 (100%)
- **Blockers**: None

### Next Steps
1. Initialize Git repository
2. Create directory structure (docs/, cad/, stl/, images/, firmware/)
3. Begin CAD modeling of front panel
4. Generate parametric mesh pattern
5. Model main body with component mounts

### Notes
- Original enclosure photos analyzed for component placement
- Design optimized for minimal print time (<7 hours total)
- Material usage target: <70g filament
- All components from original BOM will be reused
